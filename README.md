<h3>Installing Python</h3>

<p>If you don't have Python installed on your computer and wish to reproduce the workshop examples, you may download a pre-packaged version of the language called Anaconda.  Anaconda may be easier to use when starting with the language, and will contain the libraries needed for this workshop.</p>  

<p>To install the Anaconda distribution, you may follow this link:<a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/">https://www.anaconda.com/download/</a> </p> 

<p>
Choose Python 3 and use the installer for your operating system.
</p>

<p>For Mac and Linux users, Python should be already installed on your operating system by default.</p>

<h3>Packages needed</h3>

<p>For participants who already have a Python distribution installed, note that we will use the following packages:

```python
jupyter
pandas
numpy
sklearn
```
</p>
<p>If needed, you may install each package with pip, e.g.:</p>

```bash
pip install jupyter
```

<h3>Using the notebook</h3>

<p>Download the file WorkshopExamples.ipynb on your laptop</p>

<p>Launch Jypyter by clicking the shortcut or by entering the following command in a terminal:
</p>

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

<p>Open the notebook saved on your computer.<p>
